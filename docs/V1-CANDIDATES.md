# V1 Candidates

- Explicit sub-agent forking command: `deadreckon fork <run-id> --prompt "..."`, from AS-BUILT §10 and REPORT.md coordination needs.
- Provider HTTP retry taxonomy: `ProviderError::Http` currently carries provider/detail text but no HTTP status field, so the hygiene taxonomy treats it as fatal. Add a status/code field before retrying 408, 429, or 5xx provider failures.
- OpenCode SQLite ingest: current provider CLI ingest reads OpenCode file-mode `storage/session`, `storage/message`, and `storage/part` JSON only. Add SQLite-backed discovery/parsing after choosing a dependency-light strategy and fixture shape.
- Provider transcript undo/bulk-agent registration: provider-owned logs stay read-only in alpha. Any undo/replay, mass registration, or transcript mutation workflow needs a separate design that preserves provenance and provider ownership boundaries.
