# Changelog

## Codebase modes (alpha) — 2026-05-11

- P1: Added codebase mode records, fresh-mode metadata, and deterministic mode resolution plumbing without changing `PipelineState`.
- Added codebase-aware `run` defaults: clean git repos now run in an isolated `git worktree` on a `dr/...` branch, while the old empty-working-dir behavior remains behind `--fresh`.
- Added explicit copy (`--from`), worktree (`--worktree`, `--base`, `--branch`, `--allow-dirty`), and in-place (`--in-place --i-know-its-a-lot`) modes with single-screen preview and `--preview` / `--yes` scripting paths.
- Added worktree lifecycle verbs: `deadreckon apply <run-id>` with squash/merge/cherry-pick strategies and `deadreckon abandon <run-id>` with branch/worktree cleanup.
- Integrated codebase modes into `list`, `show`, `materialize`, `undo`, run completion prompts, and TUI completion actions. Worktree runs now hint apply/abandon; copy/fresh runs continue to hint materialize/extend.
- Added depth coverage for worktree creation, dirty-refusal hints, preview no-op behavior, non-TTY confirmation refusal, copy-mode ignore handling, in-place edits and undo, apply, abandon, materialize refusal, list, and show.

## Lifecycle ergonomics

Phase commits: `4481617`, `556897d`, `91ab9a6`.

- Added `deadreckon materialize <run-id> [--dest <path>] [--force] [--include-manifest]` to copy completed library artifacts to user-owned paths with `.deadreckon/parent.json` provenance and library `.materialized-to` reverse markers.
- Added `deadreckon extend <run-id> "<new-goal>"` to create a fresh run from a completed parent artifact, seed the working tree, prepend a parent summary into `history.json`, and record lineage through marker files plus a synthetic trace.
- Added lifecycle hints after completed `run`/`attach`, `--no-hints` suppression, `list` materialization status, and `show` parent-lineage output.
- Kept `PipelineState` unchanged; lifecycle lineage lives in marker files.

## 0.1.0 - Robustness Milestone (alpha)

Implementation commit: `cec49f3`.

- Hardened the run loop with broadcast/file-backed events, per-turn timers, cancellation tokens, wall-clock CLI spend accounting, partial-trace resume, and `resume --from-turn`.
- Hardened sandbox execution with generated Seatbelt/bwrap policy inputs, tmp `$HOME`, network denial, persisted profiles, and adversarial path/network tests.
- Hardened acceptance by moving `dr-gate` to `acceptance.yaml`, signing markers with a run-local nonce, and refusing forged self-attestation.
- Hardened import normalization for Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor histories into deadreckon traces/provenance.
- Hardened multi-run coordination with scope-qualified lock files and same-scope refusal tests.
- Hardened library promotion with post-gate atomic move, manifest writing, and crash recovery.

Still thin: provider pings in `doctor` are intentionally conservative unless explicitly enabled, and the TUI uses durable event replay for cross-process attach because Tokio broadcast is in-process.
